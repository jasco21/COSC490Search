COSC 490 Senior Project README

This is the readme file required for the project. This Github repository is a fork from the searx master repository and was used in the making of the website
where my Searx instance is hosted.

Hosting a private instance of SearX, whether it is from this repository or the master repository, requires a virtual environment, like an Ubuntu server, which
is what I used for my own instance. Ubuntu is free to download from the Windows store for this purpose.

From there, setting up and running a local instance of SearX can be done by booting up Ubuntu and following the step-by-step instructions laid out on SearX's
official documentation, linked below.

https://searx.github.io/searx/admin/installation-searx.html

Following these instructions up to the end will allow any user to locally host and use their own personal instance of SearX, so long as the console remains open.
For my instance specifically, you would simply need to clone this repository instead of the master SearX repository indicated in the instructions, and you would
be able to access and configure my instance of SearX with the JascoSearch theme and the particular settings that I made for my instance.

Creating a web-accessible version of SearX on a dedicated server that anyone can find, like I am doing, is a more complicated process that requires a little bit of money to start
up, let alone keep sustainable. Locally hosted instances are safer and more ideal for the average user.
